Exercise 2
Check for approximate equality by making sure the difference is less than a certain tolerance.

Exercise 6
Changed the test_sin to a tolerance check, because otherwise it would only be equal from -3 to 3. Didn't want to increase N either because that would make pytest too slow.

Factorial function was made to only work on positive numbers.
